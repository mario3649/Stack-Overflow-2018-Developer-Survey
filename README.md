# Stack Overflow Developer Survey Insights – Project Overview

## The goal of this project was to take a deep look into the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey and focus on developer job satisfaction, programming language usage, and salary distribution. Stack Overflow is a global developer community and this survey provides insight into their perspective on career paths, experiences in the workplace, and technology used. 

### The tech industry is constantly evolving so keeping in touch with active communities like Stack Overflow is crucial to understanding developers. Through surveys like this, we can figure out what are the main contributors to job satisfaction and how this can relate to salary expectations, the programming languages used, and workplace culture.  In order to do this we have done data cleaning and exploration to get a more comprehensive view of the data. Then we queried it and created an interactive dashboard to visualize the findings in a clear and concise way.


## Insights Summary
### The key metrics the we focused on were:
- **Job Satisfaction Score:** This score was made by numbering Extremely Dissatisfied, Moderately Dissatisfied, Slightly Dissatisfied, Neither Satisfied nor Dissatisfied, Slightly Satisfied, Moderately Satisfied, and Extremely Satisfied. We numbered them 1 through 7 in that order.
- **Languages:** The programming languages used by developers on Stack Overflow.
- **Converted Salary:** Developer salary converted to yearly and USD
- **Country:** The country where the developer lives.

### **Job Satisfaction Score**
- Using this score, we were able to see that on average, developers that work using Bash/Shell and MATLAB had higher job satisfaction. While most languages ranged from a 5 – 5.25 score, the one programming language that reached far below the mean was Assembly language. It had a score of 4.7.

### **Converted Salary**
-	Compensation correlates to job satisfaction heavily. The average salary for developers that were satisfied was near 100,000 USD per year. Meanwhile the average salary for developers that were “extremely dissatisfied” was 64,970 USD, which is 35.03% lower.

### **Languages**
-	The most commonly used programming languages were C and Java while the least common are CoffeeScript and MATLAB.

### **Country**
-	North America and Europe have significantly higher job satisfaction as opposed to Africa, Parts of Asia, and South America.
-	Norway has the greatest average Job Satisfaction Score at 5.542 while Namibia has the lowest score at 2.5.

## Recommendations
-	**Competative Compensation:** Compensation directly correlates to job satisfaction, which is a metric that could help businesses decrease turnover and increase efficiency. 
-	**Which Language Should You Pursue a Career in?:** If you are starting it would be crucial to learn the skills of the most commonly used languages, however, also compare them to the languages with the high amount of average satisfaction. Two programming languages that best fit these criteria are HTML and Python.
-	**Location:** If job satisfaction is an important factor in a developer’s life and moving is not an issue, it would be recommended to work for one of the countries with high job satisfaction.
